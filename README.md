freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design project - Build a Product Landing Page

Fictional guitar shop landing page forming part of the Responsive Web Design Certificate

Brand names and video are lovingly used.

Project brief was to fulfill the following user stories:

1.  Your product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header"
2.  You can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img" (A logo would make a good image here)
3.  Within the #header element, you can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar"
4.  You can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link
5.  When you click a .nav-link button in the nav element, you are taken to the corresponding section of the landing page
6.  You can watch an embedded product video with id="video"
7.  Your landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form"
8.  Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where you can enter an email address
9.  The #email input field should have placeholder text to let users know what the field is for
10. The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address
11. Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit"
12. When you click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit)
13. The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport
14. Your product landing page should have at least one media query
15. Your product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once
